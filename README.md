# https-static-site-cloudformation
Cloudformation template for provisioning everything needed for a HTTPS static site

## What

This repository contains a [Cloudformation] template and a script for provisioning:

* [AWS::S3::Bucket]
* [AWS::S3:BucketPolicy]
* [AWS::CertificateManager::Certificate]
* [AWS::CloudFront::Distribution]
* [AWS::Route53::HostedZone]
* [AWS::Route53::RecordSetGroup]

It can be used to provision a Cloudformation stack which serves a static site from a custom domain with HTTPS.

For more details on what is this script is, you can read [the blog post I wrote about it](https://watsonarw.com/2017/04/04/https-static-site-hosting-in-s3.htmlmakr)

## How

### Prerequisites

You'll need the [aws-cli] installed to run the provision script.

### Usage

Run the provision script with the domain name you're using for your static site. For example, the domain name you're using is `example.com`, run:

```sh
./provision "example.com"
```
